Remotely control large flying beetles

Associated Arduino code for remotely controlling beetles.

System components:
- Microcontroller: ATTiny85
- BLE chip: HM11
- Beetles: Hercules Beetle, Goliath Beetle, Atlas Beetle
- Battery: Whatever

Instructions:
- Add contents of hardware folder to your Documents/Arduino folder
- Connect Circuit together
- Surgically implant electrodes in beetle occipital lobes
- Go fly!

Todo:
- Diagram circuit
- verify output freq/magnitude with actual osiloscope
- move to somewhere with sufficiently large beetles (NW Indonesia Or Sothwestern USA)
- test on real beetle!
